## Manager Heartbeat Checklist

### 1. Read state.json

Read state.json (local only, no sync needed). If the file does not exist, initialize it first:

```bash
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh --action init
cat ~/state.json
```

The `active_tasks` field in state.json contains all in-progress tasks (both finite and infinite). No need to iterate over all meta.json files.

---

### 2. Check Status of Finite Tasks

Iterate over entries in `active_tasks` with `"type": "finite"`:

- Get the responsible Worker and corresponding Room from the entry's `assigned_to` and `room_id` fields
- @mention the Worker in their Room (or `project_room_id` if available) to ask for progress:
  ```
  @{worker}:{domain} How is your current task {task-id} going? Are you blocked on anything?
  ```
- Determine if the Worker is making normal progress based on their reply
- If the Worker has not responded (no response for more than one heartbeat cycle), flag the anomaly in the Room and notify the human admin
- If the Worker has replied that the task is complete but meta.json has not been updated, proactively update meta.json (status → completed, fill in completed_at), and remove the entry from `active_tasks`:
  ```bash
  bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh --action complete --task-id {task-id}
  ```

---

### 3. Check Infinite Task Timeouts

Iterate over entries in `active_tasks` with `"type": "infinite"`. For each entry:

```
Current UTC time = now

Conditions (both must be met):
  1. last_executed_at < next_scheduled_at (not yet executed this cycle)
     OR last_executed_at is null (never executed)
  2. now > next_scheduled_at + 30 minutes (overdue)

If conditions are met, @mention the Worker in the corresponding room_id to trigger execution:
  @{worker}:{domain} It's time to run your scheduled task {task-id} "{task-title}". Please execute it now and report back with the keyword "executed".
```

**Note**: Infinite tasks are never removed from active_tasks. After the Worker reports `executed`, update `last_executed_at` and `next_scheduled_at`:
```bash
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh \
  --action executed --task-id {task-id} --next-scheduled-at "{new-ISO-8601}"
```

---

### 4. Project Progress Monitoring

Scan plan.md for all active projects under /root/hiclaw-fs/shared/projects/:

```bash
for meta in /root/hiclaw-fs/shared/projects/*/meta.json; do
  cat "$meta"
done
```

- Filter projects with `"status": "active"`
- For each active project, read plan.md and find tasks marked as `[~]` (in progress)
- If the responsible Worker has had no activity during this heartbeat cycle, @mention them in the project room:
  ```
  @{worker}:{domain} Any progress on your current task {task-id} "{title}"? Please let us know if you're blocked.
  ```
- If a Worker has reported task completion in the project room but plan.md has not been updated yet, handle it immediately (see the project management section in AGENTS.md)

---

### 5. Capacity Assessment

- Count the number of `type=finite` entries in state.json (finite tasks in progress) and identify idle Workers with no assigned tasks
- If Workers are insufficient, check in with the human admin about whether new Workers need to be created
- If Workers are idle, suggest reassigning tasks

---

### 6. Worker Container Lifecycle Management

Only execute when the container API is available (check first):

```bash
bash -c 'source /opt/hiclaw/scripts/lib/container-api.sh && container_api_available && echo available'
```

If the output is `available`, proceed with the following steps:

1. Sync status:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-management/scripts/lifecycle-worker.sh --action sync-status
   ```

2. Detect idle Workers: For each Worker, if there are no finite tasks for them in state.json and container_status=running:
   - If idle_since is not set, set it to the current time
   - If (now - idle_since) > idle_timeout_minutes, perform auto-stop:
     ```bash
     bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-management/scripts/lifecycle-worker.sh --action check-idle
     ```
   - Log in the Manager's Room with that Worker:
     "Worker <name> container has been automatically paused due to idle timeout. It will be automatically resumed when a task is assigned."

3. If a Worker has a running finite task but its container status is stopped (anomaly), start it and send an alert:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-management/scripts/lifecycle-worker.sh --action start --worker <name>
   ```

### 7. Reply

- If all Workers are healthy and there are no pending items: HEARTBEAT_OK
- Otherwise: Summarize findings and recommended actions, and notify the human admin
